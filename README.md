<h1>Easy Access: First-Year Student Portal</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Easy Access</strong> is a tailored solution for first-year (extended program) students at Tshwane University of Technology. 
    The project addresses the confusion students face with messages received via Brightspace, where message recipients were often unclear. 
    This initiative was inspired by a request from the students themselves and was developed to streamline communication and provide clarity.
